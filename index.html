    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif; font-size: larger;text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px; line-height: 42px;">Digital payments are transactions that occur via digital or online modes. This means both the payer and the payee use electronic mediums to exchange money.
        The Government of India has taken several measures to promote and encourage digital payments. As part of the ‘Digital India’ campaign, the government aims to create a ‘digitally empowered’ economy that is ‘faceless, paperless, and cashless’. There are various methods and types of digital payments.    
        You must note that digital payments can take place through the Internet as well as on physical premises. Here are some examples of digital payments, buying something from e-commerce platforms and paying for it via UPI (unified payments interface) qualifies as a digital payment. Similarly, if you purchase something from your local grocery store and choose to pay via UPI, that also is a digital payment. 
        Now that you clearly understand what is digital payment, let us understand the process of payments.
        The transition to digital payments and receipts has some clear benefits, especially for small businesses in India.  Consumers and businesses now expect the digital payments facility to be made available for faster and more secure payments with no risk and no charges. The payer has a mobile phone which provides additional authentication via fingerprint or other verification or biometric method, minimizing risk. 
        For business transactions too, there are several benefits of going cashless.Digital payments are payments done through digital or online modes, with no exchange of hard cash being involved. Such a payment, sometimes also called an electronic payment (e-payment), is the transfer of value from one payment account to another where both the payer and the payee use a digital device such as a mobile phone, computer, or a credit, debit, or prepaid card. 
        The payer and payee could be either a business or an individual. This means that for digital payments to take place, the payer and payee both must have a bank account, an online banking method, a device from which they can make the payment, and a medium of transmission, meaning that either they should have signed up to a payment provider or an intermediary such as a bank or a service provider.
